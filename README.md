## Posts

This is a mern stack app as a CRUD and built as a twitter like app.

The current repo serves as the front-end part of the app and
is designed using React.

This app was designed and built by myself and serves as an example of
a side project which I'm currently working on.

The backend can be found at: https://github.com/RyanG91/posts.

### Current features:
* Create posts
* Delete posts
* Edit posts
* Login required
* Likes counter
* Dislikes counter
* Author of posts
* Styling
* Time posts were created

### Future features:
* Comments
* Like and dislike comments
* Author and time of comments
* Filter comments
* Like/Dislike bar
* Favourite post
* Tests
* Further styling
* Potential deployment (Database is currently local)

These future features may change over time if they are implemented and
if I come up with other ideas which could expand the app further.
